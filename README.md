### Personal Notes
I made this app to try out ReactJS and Sass. Hope its useful!
- Also do note that this isn't mobile friendly - it was made for computers and larger screen sizes. Resizing the window will kill the layout.
- I've decided to commit everything in my app folder since this isn't for work or anything. RIP my git history.
